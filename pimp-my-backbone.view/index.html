<p>
    I've been using <em>Backbone.js</em> in a couple of projects now and my feelings about it are quite diverse. On the one hand, I like how it provides you with guidelines on how to structure your frontend code. Although splitting model and view is a very basic idea in software development, it also is very powerful. <em>Backbone.js</em> is of great help by providing collections which aggregate model instances and being able to sync these models via RESTful interfaces. On the other hand, it always (and I hope that it's not just me) seems to be a pain in the b*** to figure out the best way to implement a proper view lifecycle and to keep track of all registered event handlers. If you aren't careful when removing or even just re-rendering views, you can seriously 1. mess up event handling and 2. prevent proper garbage collection. If you are just a little sloppy, this leads to a slow frontend with an always increasing memory footprint.<br />
    I'm not saying that <em>Backbone.js</em> is bad in handling UI events, just that you have to care about too many things that are common to most web applications.

<h2 id="react_pragmatically">React pragmatically</h2>

<p>A few days ago, Facebook and Instagram published a JavaScript framework of theirs: <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react"><em>React</em></a>.</p>

<p>
    <em>React</em> has some interesting concepts for JavaScript view objects that can be used to eliminate one problem of <em>Backbone.js</em>.<br />
    As in most MVC implementations (although React is mostly just a <i>V</i> implementation), a view is one portion of the screen that is managed by a controlling object. This object is responsible for deciding when to re-render the view and how to react to user input. With <em>React</em>, these portions are defined as components. A component knows how to render the view it represents and how to react to user input (mouse, keyboard, touch, ... events). The interesting thing is that <em>React</em> is figuring out by itself when to re-render a view and how to do this in the most efficient way. Let's have a look at <a href="https://github.com/seiffert/blog-articles/pimp-my-backbone.view/tree/master/examples/todolist-react">an example</a>:</p>

<pre>
/** @jsx React.DOM */
var TodoListItem = React.createClass({
    render: function () {
        return <li>{this.props.todo.text}</li>;
    }
});

var TodoList = React.createClass({
    getInitialState: function () {
        return { todos: [{ text: 'Dishes', dueDate: new Date() }] };
    },

    render: function () {
        var todos = this.state.todos.map(function (todo) {
            return <TodoListItem todo={todo} />;
        });

        return <ul>{todos}</ul>;
    }
});

React.renderComponent(<TodoList />, document.body);
</pre>

<p>
    This short snippet of code is defining two view components: <code>TodoListItem</code> and <code>TodoList</code>. Every time a <code>TodoList</code> is created, it is equipped with a default todo (I have to remind myself of this every day!) and when being rendered, the list delegates the rendering of the todos to the <code>TodoListItem</code> component. It then places them in a new <code><div></code> element. You might think that this is some kind of pseudocode - it's not! This is JavaScript with <em>JSX</em> which is being transformed to pure JavaScript before being executed. If you want to learn more about it, have a look at [React's documentation](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/syntax.html) - it's really simple to get started!
</p>

<p>
    So far, you haven't seen more code than required to render a simple list. However, the simplicity of this short snippet gives you a good idea of the rest of the framework - it's really not much more than that. The same functionality implemented with <em>Backbone.js</em> would look somewhat <a href="https://github.com/seiffert/blog-articles/pimp-my-backbone.view/tree/master/examples/todolist-backbone">like this</a>:
</p>

<pre>
var TodoListItem = Backbone.View.extend({
    tagName: 'li',

    render: function () {
        this.model.on('change', this.render, this);
        this.model.on('remove', this.remove, this);

        this.$el.html(this.model.get('text'));
    },

    remove: function () {
        this.model.off(null, null, this);

        Backbone.View.prototype.remove.apply(this, arguments);
    }
});

var TodoList = Backbone.View.extend({
    tagName: 'ul',

    listItems: null,

    initialize: function () {
        this.listItems = {};
    },

    render: function () {
        this.$el.empty();

        this.removeListItems();

        this.model.on('add', this.onTodoAdded, this);
        this.model.on('reset', this.render, this);

        this.model.each(function (todo) {
            var listItem = this.getListItemForTodo(todo);

            listItem.render();

            this.$el.append(listItem.$el);
        }, this);
    },

    remove: function () {
        this.removeListItems();
        this.model.off(null, null, this);

        Backbone.View.prototype.remove.apply(this, arguments);
    },

    removeListItems: function () {
        _.invoke(this.listItems, 'remove');
    },

    getListItemForTodo: function (todo) {
        if (_.isUndefined(this.listItems[todo.text])) {
            this.listItems[todo.text] = new TodoListItem({
                model: todo
            });
        }

        return this.listItems[todo.text];
    },

    onAddTodo: function (todo, collection) {
        var index = collection.indexOf(todo),
            listItem = this.getListItemForTodo(todo);

        this.insertListItemAtIndex(listItem, index);
    },

    insertListItemAtIndex: function (listItem, index) {
        var $list = this.$el;

        if ($list.children().length < index) {
            $list.append(listItem.$el);
        } else {
            $list.children().eq(index).prepend(listItem.$el);
        }
    }
});

var list = new TodoList({
    model: new Backbone.Collection([
        {
            text: 'Dishes!',
            dueDate: new Date()
        }
    ])
});
list.render();

list.$el.appendTo(document.body);
</pre>

<p>
    This is at least the best approach to a proper handling the view lifecycle I have come across. As you can see: all the logic for keeping model and view in sync can be omitted with React.
</p>

<h2 id="react_amd">React AMD</h2>

<p>
    There still exists one problem when mixing <em>Backbone.JS</em> code and <em>React</em> code: Although the <em>React</em> sources itself can be loaded with an <em>AMD</em> loader (like <a href="http://requirejs.org"><em>require.js</em></a>), the code written for the use with <em>React</em> contains these weird-looking snippets I explained to be <em>JSX</em>. Without an <em>AMD</em> loader this is not a problem: <em>JSX</em> source code is included in script tags with a specific type (<code><script type="text/jsx">...</script></code>). Scripts with this type are being detected by a the <code>JXSTransformer</code> which translates the <em>JSX</em> source code into pure JavaScript. If you know how <em>require.js</em> works, you can now figure out what the problem is.
</p>

<p>
    For every module you load with <em>require.js</em>, a new <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag is added to the <code><head></code> of your HTML document. Sadly, it is not possible to specify the <code>type</code> of each of these <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags. To be able to load JXS source files with <em>require.js</em>, we have to use some other approach. The problem reminded me of the case in which a file you load via require does not pure JavaScript code either - <strong>templates</strong>. The default method to load templates with <em>require.js</em> is to use the <em>text</em> plugin. Therefore I had a look at how plugins work and whether it might be possible to load <em>JSX</em> code with a plugin, transform it in the client, and execute the resulting JavaScript code afterwards. What I came up with is now available on <a href="https://github.com/seiffert/require-jsx">GitHub</a> and can be used for exactly this use case.
</p>

<p>Now that we can load source files containing <em>JSX</em> code, we can finally combine <em>Backbone.js</em> and <em>React</em>.</p>

<h2 id="reactive_backbone">Reactive Backbone</h2>

<p>First, we need to set up a little <em>Backbone.js</em> application just like we would do without <em>React</em>. Whether you do this with <a href="http://yeoman.io"><em>Yeoman</em></a>, just <a href="http://bower.io/"><em>Bower</em></a>, or manually doesn't really matter. You will end up with an html document similar to this one</p>

<pre>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/lib/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css" />
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/style.css" />
    </head>
    <body>
        <script data-main="app/main" src="/lib/require.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
</pre>

<p>and some JavaScript file (in our case the <code>app/main.js</code> script) that configures the application:</p>

<pre>
require.config({
    deps: ["main"],
    paths: {
        jquery: "../lib/jquery-1.9.1",
        lodash: "../lib/lodash.compat",
        backbone: "../lib/backbone",
        text: "../lib/text"
    },
    shim: {
        backbone: {
            deps: ["lodash", "jquery"],
            exports: "Backbone"
        }
    }
});

require(['backbone', 'app'], function(Backbone, app) {
  app.run();
});
</pre>

<p>In the application's <code>run</code> method I would like to start <em>Backbone.js</em>' history and let a router control the application. In the router, I would then render view components. To be able to do this, the router needs to know about <em>React</em> and also contain some <em>JSX</em>:</p>

<pre>
define(['backbone', 'react', 'jsx!view/todoList'], function (Backbone, React, TodoList) {
  return Backbone.Router.extend({
    routes: {
      '*default': 'defaultAction'
    },

    defaultAction: function () {
      var todos = new Backbone.Collection([
        {
          text: 'Dishes!',
          dueDate: new Date()
        }
      ]);

      React.renderComponent(
        <TodoList todos={todos} />,
        document.body
      );
    }
  });
});
</pre>

<p>If we would try to load this file with the default require.js mechanism, we would probably get an <code>Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <</code>. Now we need to use the above mentioned require.js plugin:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get it from <a href="https://github.com/seiffert/require-jsx">here</a></li>
<li>Put it into your JavaScript directory</li>
<li><p>Update your require.js configuration in a way that it can find the plugin and React</p>

<pre>require.config({
    deps: ["main"],
    paths: {
        jquery: "../lib/jquery-1.9.1",
        lodash: "../lib/lodash.compat",
        backbone: "../lib/backbone",
        jsx: "../lib/jsx",
        JSXTransformer: '../lib/JSXTransformer',
        react: '../lib/react'
    },
    shim: {
        backbone: {
            deps: ["lodash", "jquery"],
            exports: "Backbone"
        },
        JSXTransformer: {
            deps: ["react"],
            exports: "JSXTransformer"
        },
        react: {
            exports: "React"
        }
    }
});


require(['backbone', 'app', 'jsx!router'], function(Backbone, app, Router) {
    app.router = new Router();
    app.run();
});
</pre></li>
</ol>

<p>As you can see, I did not only update the <code>require.config</code> part of our main script, but also added the initialization of our <code>Router</code>. The important part here is that when specifying the dependencies of our main script, we reference the router with <code>'jsx!router'</code>. This tells require.js to use the <em>JSX</em> plugin to load the file <code>router.js</code>.</p>

<p>The resulting application can be found in the mentioned <a href="https://github.com/seiffert/blog-articles/pimp-my-backbone.view/tree/master/examples/todolist-reactive-backbone">repository on GitHub in the demo directory</a>.</p>

<h3 id="code">Code</h3>

<p>If you want to compare the three different approaches used to render this simple Todo list, have a look at the code:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/seiffert/blog-articles/pimp-my-backbone.view/tree/master/examples/todolist-react">Todos with React</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/seiffert/blog-articles/pimp-my-backbone.view/tree/master/examples/todolist-backbone">Todos with Backbone.JS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/seiffert/blog-articles/pimp-my-backbone.view/tree/master/examples/todolist-reactive-backbone">Todos with Reactive Backbone</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully, this article was able to highlight the benefits of combining React and Backbone.JS and convince you to give it a try. If you have any questions or want to give me feedback, feel free to add a comment or contact me via <a href="https://twitter.com/SeiffertP">Twitter</a>.</p>
