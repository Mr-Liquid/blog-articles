<p>In <a href="http://blog.mayflower.de/archives/792-05.12.-Doctrine-2.html">yesterday's article</a> of our advent calendar, we explained the concepts underlying <i>Doctrine 2</i>. In today's article, we want to use that knowledge and create a simple <i>Zend Framework</i> (<i>ZF</i>) application that uses <i>Doctrine 2</i> to persist its business objects.
</p>

<p>While explaining how to integrate <i>Doctrine 2</i> into <i>Zend Framework</i>, we will create a generic sandbox that can be used for future projects building up on these technologies.

<h1>Setting up a ZF project with Doctrine 2</h1>

<p>
    Since this article is not about how to setup a <i>ZF</i> project, the following steps will require you to have a clean but working project with 
    the usual folder structure.<br />
    To use <i>Doctrine 2</i> you will have to get a copy of its source code first. You can get one either from the project's <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm/2.1/download/2.1.4">website</a> or by cloning the git repository. In my opinion, downloading the source package from the 
    website is a lot easier (you don't have to take care of all the project's git submodules etc.). So download and extract the archive into a 
    temporary directory. After that, move the folder <code>Doctrine</code> from the archive's root into the <code>library</code> of your new
    <i>ZF</i> application. Now, your project structure should look like this:
</p>

<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1436040.js?file=gistfile1.txt"></script>
<br />

<p>
    The first thing that will occur to you if you look at the <i>Doctrine 2</i> source code is that 100% of the code is
    namespaced (for a (German) introduction to namespaces have a look at the article "<a href="http://blog.mayflower.de/archives/786-02.12.-PHP-5.3-Features-in-real-life.html">PHP 5.3 Features in Real Life</a>" from a colleague of mine). This is pretty nice for people who are not scared of new 
    language constructs but for many people that are using <i>ZF</i> it might look odd at first. I am sure that you will get familiar with the syntax
    differences really fast, but <i>ZF</i> (1) does not - because it does support real namespacing yet (however this will change with version 2).<br />
    Therefore we have to do some additional work that enables us to autoload classes that reside in namespaces. Luckily, <i>Doctrine 2</i> comes with 
    a neat set of helper classes bundled in the project <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/common"><i>Doctrine Common</i></a> which 
    also includes a class loader that fulfills our needs. The class loader is called <code>Doctrine\Common\ClassLoader</code> and is really easy to use:
</p>

<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1436045.js?file=gistfile1.aw"></script>
<br />

<p>
    This code snippet creates and registers a new class loader that looks for classes in the namespace <i>Doctrine</i>. These classes should 
    be placed in a folder called <i>Doctrine</i> which is part of the current include path. Every namespace separator will be transformed into a
    directory separator when looking for the classes, so make sure to keep your class-, namespace-, file- and folder-names in sync! 
</p>

<p>
    I recommend putting the initialization of the class loader into your application's bootstrap class because this way it can be used for cli 
    scripts, too. As you might have seen, there are several packages inside the <i>Doctrine</i> folder that we placed in your <i>library</i>. 
    The folders <i>ORM</i>, <i>DBAL</i> and <i>Common</i> contain the <i>Doctrine 2</i> classes required by the framework. The fourth folder 
    <i>Symfony</i> contains some classes borrowed from the <a href="http://symfony.com"><i>Symfony2</i></a> framework. To load all these classes,
    we have to initialize multiple class loaders:
</p>

<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1436046.js?file=gistfile1.aw"></script>
<br />

<p>
    The initialization of the loaders responsible for <i>Symfony2</i> and entity classes requires a second argument, that indicates the directory
    in which the classes of the namespaces can be found. If you do not provide this argument, the class loader just looks in the directories of your
    include path for folder names matching the given namespace.
</p>
<br />
<h2>Creating the Entity Manager</h2>

<p>
    The next thing we will do is creating an entity manager. To do so, we have to initialize a configuration object (of the type
    <code>Doctrine\ORM\Configuration</code>) and pass it to the entity manager. Since we want to create a project that can be configured easily, 
    we separate the configuration data from the initialization code. Let's begin with the initialization code and add the required configuration 
    directives to our <code>application.ini</code> file later.<br /><br />

    Instead of describing each single option here, I add some detailed comments in the initialization code:
</p>

<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1436051.js?file=gistfile1.aw"></script>
<br />

<p>
    From now on, you can access the entity manager by requesting it from the <code>Zend_Registry</code>. This should probably be done via a 
    dependency injection system, but this article will not cover how to implement dependency injection or even a dependency injection container.<br />
    To make this bootstrap code work, you will have to add the following directives to your <code>application.ini</code>:
</p>

<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1436056.js?file=gistfile1.txt"></script>
<br />

<p>
    Basically, this is all you have to do to integrate <i>Doctrine 2</i> into your <i>ZF</i> application. It is fully functional with this
    configuration, so let us take a snapshot of the project now and declare it as our sandbox for future <i>ZF-Doctrine 2</i> projects.<br />\
    Next, I want to show you how to create entity classes within your project and how to initialize a database scheme from these entities.
</p>
<br /> 
<h2>Creating Entity Classes</h2>

<p>
    If you have read my <a href="http://blog.mayflower.de/archives/792-05.12.-Doctrine-2.html">yesterday's article</a>, the following part will not 
    look very new to you. I will create two entity classes: <i>User</i> and <i>Group</i> which have a n:m relationship called <i>membership</i>.
</p>

<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1436060.js?file=gistfile1.aw"></script>
<br />

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1436062.js?file=gistfile1.aw"></script>
<br />

<p>
    To write create tables in the database for these entities, we will use <i>Doctrine</i>'s console tools which are really handy. Create a new 
    script named <code>doctrine.php</code> in your application's <code>bin</code> directory and copy the following code snippet into it.
</p>

<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1436064.js?file=gistfile1.aw"></script>
<br />

<p>
    This script sets up a <code>Zend_Application</code> first, bootstraps it and creates a normal <i>Doctrine 2</i> console. You might want to have a 
    look at the original console script which is included in the <i>Doctrine 2</i> archive we downloaded before. I added the <i>ZF</i> initialization
    to be able to use the application's configuration here.<br /><br />

    When you run the script now, the output should look like this:
</p>

<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1436069.js?file=gistfile1.txt"></script>
<br />

<p>
    All actions related to your database's schema have the prefix <code>orm:schema-tool</code>. Create your schema now by executing <br /><br />

    <code>$ php bin/doctrine.php orm:schema-tool:create</code><br /><br />

    If you have no errors in your configuration, your database should have three new tables now: <code>user</code>, <code>group</code> and <code>group_user</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Now you are ready to implement your application's logic. You can write code that queries, modifies and creates user and group objects and have 
    all data persisted by <i>Doctrine 2</i>. To end this article, I just want to give you a feeling for how you might interact with
    <i>Doctrine 2</i> in your business logic.

    I hope this article helps you setting up the infrastructure for your next project and covers everything you have to know to begin using
    <i>Doctrine 2</i>. The sandbox we set up can be downloaded <a href="/uploads/PaulBlog/sandbox.tgz">here</a>. Make sure to include the current versions of <i>ZF</i> and
    <i>Doctrine 2</i> after downloading it.
