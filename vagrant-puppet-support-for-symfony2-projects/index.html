<h3>Motivation</h3>

Setting up a new project and its development environment can be quite a pain in the ***. Even after the infrastructure of this project is already set up, adding new developers to the team often requires way too much time. Often this time is spent on installing virtual machines, web- and database-servers, updating libraries and so on. 

Many IT companies use the same technologies repeatedly which leaves them with multiple development environments that look pretty similar but have been set up separately. 

<h3>@Mayflower</h3>
At Mayflower, we are developing PHP and JavaScript applications using modern frameworks like Symfony2 and Backbone.js. Having many customer projects with this technology stack, we are always trying to improve our workflows. One improvement we did some time ago (> 1 year now) was to use vagrant and puppet to set up virtual machines that imitate the software's target platforms as good as possible.

Before that, each of our teams was working with virtual machine images that were transferred to new computers using USB drives. The problem was that even the slightest change on the virtual machine required multiple developers to spend time on copying the new image from the shared storage to their computers, configure it as their virtual machine's new disk image and restart their whole development environment.

When our system administrators then started using puppet and encouraged developer teams to follow their lead, many people were doubtful or even intimidated by the new technology.
A few months later, everybody is using vagrant/puppet and nobody wants to work without it anymore. In the mean time I set up more than 5 projects that started from scratch with vagrant and puppet. Having seen a lot of time being wasted while defining similar infrastructures again and again, I am currently working on several ideas that might lead to more efficient solutions.

<h3>Vagrant ^ Puppet</h3>
Sadly, the scope of this article is way too limited to provide a comprehensive guide on the usage of vagrant and puppet. Nevertheless I would like to give you a very short introduction.

<b>Vagrant</b> is a software that enables you to manage virtual machines via command line, initialize them very quickly using templates (<i>base boxes</i>) and provision them with software configurations.

This is the point when <b>Puppet</b> enters the stage. Puppet lets you describe a systems configuration via so-called <i>manifests</i>. Manifests contain facts about systems that can be applied in the provisioning process of a vagrant VM.

<h3>Symfony2 ‚ù§ Vagrant/Puppet</h3>
My approach to reduce project set-up time is to provide an additional Symfony2 Distribution that contains configurations for vagrant and puppet.
